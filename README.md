# PEOPUF
Data and processing functions for Plasmonic Enhanced studies of Optical Physically Unclonable Functions.
 All data in h5 format.
 Note that when Hamming Distances are computed, random combiantions of wavelengths are used to sample the data available, hence everytime the code is run, slight variations in the plots and average parameters will appear. To modify this behaviour, start the matlab random generator at any user defined seed value.
 
The datasets here corresponds to those measurements used for the report on plasmonic enhanced OPUFs. For access to additional datasets, please contact the authors directly.
